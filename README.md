# ML_Obesity
Individual Project for ML1

Executive Summary

besity is a health problem that can lead to increased risk of diseases and other health problems. Ensuring a health population is one of the concerns of governments and schools. This study applied different machine learning models to classify obesity and find out what are the top predictors of obesity. 

The model with the best accuracy is the `Gradient Boosting Method with an accuracy of 90.56%, better than the PCC of 62.89%`. `Age` is the top predictor of obesity, followed by `family history of obesity`, `frequency of consumption of vegetables`(inverse relationship) and `time using devices`. For policy making related to obesity, we may want to target increasing consumption of vegetables and lessening time spent in front of gadgets to help lower the obesity rate of a jurisdiction.

Extension of learning beyond what was discussed in class include the use of `GridSearchCV` (improved AutoML code) and exploration of other classifiers such as `Adaboost` and `Voting Classifier`.
